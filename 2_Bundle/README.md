# Theory Assignment

## 1. What is NPM?
NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript and is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It helps developers to install, share, and manage dependencies (libraries and tools) in their projects. NPM also provides a registry where developers can publish their own packages.

## 2. What is Parcel/vite? Why do we need it?
- **Parcel**: Parcel is a web application bundler that offers blazing fast performance using multicore processing and requires zero configuration.
- **Vite**: Vite is a build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects, using native ES module imports during development and compiling them to a production-ready format.

### Why do we need it?
We need tools like Parcel and Vite to:
- Bundle and optimize code for production.
- Provide a fast and efficient development environment with features like hot module replacement (HMR).
- Handle assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript in a seamless manner.

## 3. What is .parcel-cache?
`.parcel-cache` is a directory created by Parcel to store cached data. This cache helps speed up subsequent builds by avoiding redundant work and reusing previous results. It is typically not included in version control systems like Git.

## 4. What is npx?
`npx` is a tool that comes with NPM (version 5.2.0 and above) and allows you to run executable packages directly from the NPM registry without installing them globally on your system. This is useful for running one-off commands or scripts.

## 5. What is the difference between dependencies vs devDependencies?
- **Dependencies**: These are packages required for the application to run in production. They are listed in the `dependencies` section of the `package.json` file.
- **DevDependencies**: These are packages required only during the development and testing phases. They are listed in the `devDependencies` section of the `package.json` file.

## 6. What is Tree Shaking?
Tree shaking is a process used in JavaScript bundlers to eliminate dead code (unused code) from the final bundle. It helps reduce the bundle size by only including the code that is actually used in the application.

## 7. What is Hot Module Replacement?
Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature in module bundlers like Webpack and Parcel that allows modules to be replaced in a running application without requiring a full page reload. This improves the development experience by preserving the application's state.

## 8. List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.
1. Zero Configuration
2. Fast Performance
3. Hot Module Replacement
4. Asset Management
5. Tree Shaking

### Descriptions:
- **Zero Configuration**: Parcel works out of the box without the need for complex configuration files. This means developers can get started quickly and focus on writing code rather than setting up build tools.
- **Fast Performance**: Parcel uses multicore processing to speed up the build process, making it significantly faster than many other bundlers.
- **Hot Module Replacement**: HMR allows developers to see changes in their application instantly without a full page reload, which speeds up the development process and provides a smoother experience.

## 9. What is .gitignore? What should we add and not add into it?
`.gitignore` is a file in Git that specifies which files and directories should be ignored and not tracked by Git. 

### What to add:
- Node modules (`node_modules/`)
- Build directories (`dist/`, `build/`)
- Environment files (`.env`)
- Cache directories (e.g., `.parcel-cache/`, `.cache/`)

### What not to add:
- Source code files
- Configuration files necessary for the project to run

## 10. What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
- **package.json**: This file contains metadata about the project, including dependencies, scripts, and version information. It is meant to be manually edited by developers.
- **package-lock.json**: This file is automatically generated and contains the exact versions of dependencies and their dependencies, ensuring consistent installs across different environments.

## 11. Why should I not modify package-lock.json?
You should not modify `package-lock.json` manually because it is automatically generated and managed by NPM to ensure consistency in the dependency tree. Manual changes can lead to unexpected issues and inconsistencies.

## 12. What is node_modules? Is it a good idea to push that on Git?
`node_modules` is a directory where NPM installs all the dependencies required by the project. It is not a good idea to push `node_modules` to Git because it can be very large and it is regenerated by running `npm install` based on `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

## 13. What is the dist folder?
The `dist` (distribution) folder contains the compiled and minified version of the source code that is ready for production. This is the code that will be deployed to the server.

## 14. What is browserlists?
Browserslist is a tool used to specify which browsers should be supported by your project. It is used by tools like Babel, Autoprefixer, and others to ensure compatibility with the specified browsers.

## Additional Readings:
- **Different bundlers**: Learn about Vite, Webpack, Parcel.
- **Caret (^) and Tilde (~) in versioning**: Understand the difference in NPM versioning.
- **Script types in HTML**: Refer to MDN Docs for detailed information.
